\begin{abstract}
This whitepaper introduces \emph{Whiplash}, a novel automated market maker (AMM) designed specifically for the memecoin market. Whiplash makes an already volatile asset class even more volatile by combining spot and leverage trading within a unified liquidity framework, requiring zero seed capital for new token launches. By employing the Uniswap V2 style invariant with modifications to accommodate leveraged positions, Whiplash enables a novel trading experience while ensuring the underlying AMM remains solvent at all times. We describe the mathematical foundation, operational mechanics for launching tokens, opening and closing leveraged positions, and a robust liquidation mechanism that protects the protocol during periods of extreme volatility.

\section{Introduction}

The memecoin market represents one of the most volatile sectors in the cryptocurrency space. Whiplash aims to amplify this volatility by providing a permissionless platform where traders can engage in both spot and leveraged trading from day zero, without requiring seed capital for liquidity provision. This whitepaper outlines how Whiplash modifies the traditional constant product AMM to facilitate leveraged trading while maintaining protocol solvency.

\subsection{Motivation}
Traditional AMMs, such as Uniswap, require significant seed capital to establish liquidity for new tokens. Additionally, leveraged trading typically exists in separate protocols disconnected from spot markets. Whiplash addresses both limitations by:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Enabling permissionless token creation without seed capital requirements
    \item Unifying spot and leverage trading within a single liquidity pool
    \item Ensuring protocol solvency through a novel approach to token distribution and leverage mechanics
\end{itemize}

\section{Mathematical Foundation}

At the core of Whiplash is a modified Uniswap V2 style AMM with the constant product invariant:

\begin{equation}
x \cdot y = k
\end{equation}

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $x$ represents the reserve of the base asset (stablecoin or SOL)
    \item $y$ represents the reserve of the memecoin token
    \item $k$ is a constant value maintained during spot trading
\end{itemize}

Unlike traditional AMMs, Whiplash introduces modifications to accommodate leveraged trading and zero seed capital token launches.

\subsection{Virtual Reserves Model}

For new token launches, Whiplash employs a "virtual reserves" model for the base asset side of the pool:

\begin{equation}
x_{\text{virtual}} \cdot y_{\text{real}} = k_{\text{initial}}
\end{equation}

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $x_{\text{virtual}}$ is the virtual reserve of the base asset
    \item $y_{\text{real}}$ is the real reserve containing 100\% of the token supply
    \item $k_{\text{initial}}$ is the initial constant product value
\end{itemize}

This approach enables token creation without requiring real base asset liquidity, as the token supply is fixed and 100\% contained within the liquidity pool at launch.

\section{Token Launch Mechanism}

The token launch process in Whiplash represents a significant innovation in the AMM space:

\subsection{Initial State}
When a new memecoin token is created:

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
y_{\text{total}} &= \text{Total token supply} \\
y_{\text{pool}} &= y_{\text{total}} \quad \text{(100\% of tokens in pool)} \\
x_{\text{virtual}} &= \text{Initial virtual base asset reserve}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

The initial constant product is established as:

\begin{equation}
k_{\text{initial}} = x_{\text{virtual}} \cdot y_{\text{pool}}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Zero Sum Game Property}

A key mathematical property that enables Whiplash's innovative approach is the zero-sum nature of the token ecosystem:

\begin{equation}
\forall t: y_{\text{pool},t} + y_{\text{users},t} = y_{\text{total}}
\end{equation}

where $t$ represents any point in time after launch. This invariant ensures that the sum of tokens in the pool and in user wallets always equals the total supply, creating a closed system.

This property guarantees that the virtual reserves model remains solvent because there can never be a scenario where more tokens are demanded from the pool than exist in total circulation.

\section{Leverage Trading Mechanism}

Whiplash introduces a novel approach to leverage trading that modifies the constant product invariant temporarily while positions are open. To ensure protocol solvency, the change in the invariant is tracked and used to settle the position.

\subsection{Opening a Leveraged Position}

When a trader opens a leveraged position with collateral $c$ and leverage factor $L$:

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\text{Collateral} &= c \\
\text{Effective trade size} &= c \cdot L \\
\text{Borrowed amount} &= c \cdot (L - 1)
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

The trade is executed as a spot trade of size $c \cdot L$, and the resulting tokens are stored in a position manager:

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\Delta y &= \frac{y_{\text{pre}} \cdot c \cdot L}{x_{\text{pre}} + c \cdot L} \\
y_{\text{position}} &= \Delta y
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

Opening the position alters the pool's reserves and its constant product, $k$. The user's collateral $c$ is added to the base asset reserve.

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
x_{\text{post}} &= x_{\text{pre}} + c \\
y_{\text{post}} &= y_{\text{pre}} - \Delta y \\
k_{\text{post}} &= x_{\text{post}} \cdot y_{\text{post}}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

The deviation in the constant product, $\Delta k$, is calculated and stored with the position. This value is crucial for correctly closing the position later.

\begin{equation}
\Delta k = k_{\text{pre}} - k_{\text{post}} = (x_{\text{pre}} \cdot y_{\text{pre}}) - ((x_{\text{pre}} + c) \cdot (y_{\text{pre}} - \Delta y))
\end{equation}

\subsection{Mathematical Impact on Reserves}

For a long position, the reserves are modified as shown above. The stored $\Delta k$ represents the exact amount by which the pool's invariant must be adjusted when the position is closed to ensure the pool remains solvent and the user's profit or loss is correctly calculated.

\section{Closing a Leveraged Position}

When a trader closes a leveraged position, the protocol uses the stored $\Delta k$ to restore the invariant and calculate the final payout. This process ensures that the trader's PnL reflects market movements while keeping the AMM's core mathematics sound.

\subsection{Position Closure Calculation}

To close a position, the user returns their $y_{\text{position}}$ tokens. The protocol calculates the base asset payout, $X_{\text{out}}$, by determining how many base assets must be paid out to restore the original constant product invariant, $k$. The payout is given by:

\begin{equation}
X_{\text{out}} = \frac{x_{\text{current}} \cdot y_{\text{position}} - \Delta k}{y_{\text{current}} + y_{\text{position}}}
\end{equation}

Here, $x_{\text{current}}$ and $y_{\text{current}}$ are the pool's reserves at the time of closing. The term $x_{\text{current}} \cdot y_{\text{position}}$ represents the value of the position's tokens in terms of the base asset, adjusted for swap impact, from which the stored $\Delta k$ is subtracted to ensure the pool's invariant is restored.

This payout, $X_{\text{out}}$, includes the user's initial collateral plus any profits, or minus any losses. The user's Profit and Loss (PnL) on their initial collateral is:

\begin{equation}
\text{PnL} = X_{\text{out}} - c
\end{equation}

\section{Liquidation Mechanism}

The liquidation mechanism protects the protocol by ensuring that underwater positions are closed before they generate bad debt. It relies on the same $\Delta k$ mechanic to settle positions.

\subsection{Liquidation Condition}

A position is eligible for liquidation if and only if its value is exactly enough, or not enough, to restore the $\Delta k$ to the pool. This corresponds to the point where the trader's payout, $X_{\text{out}}$, would be zero or negative. A position must be liquidated when the trader's collateral is fully depleted.

The liquidation condition is met when $X_{\text{out}} \le 0$. Using the formula for $X_{\text{out}}$:

\begin{equation}
\frac{x_{\text{current}} \cdot y_{\text{position}} - \Delta k}{y_{\text{current}} + y_{\text{position}}} \le 0
\end{equation}

Since the denominator is always positive, this simplifies to a clear and elegant condition:

\begin{equation}
x_{\text{current}} \cdot y_{\text{position}} \le \Delta k
\end{equation}

This means a position is liquidatable when the value of the position's tokens (at the marginal price, $x_{\text{current}}$) is less than or equal to the stored $\Delta k$. At this point, all of the position's value is required to make the pool whole.

\subsection{Liquidation Price}

The liquidation price is the AMM price ($P = x/y$) at which the liquidation condition is met. We can find this by substituting the price into the condition:

\begin{equation}
(P_{\text{liquidation}} \cdot y_{\text{current}}) \cdot y_{\text{position}} \le \Delta k
\end{equation}

Solving for the price is complex due to the interdependence of the variables. However, the core condition $x \cdot y_{\text{position}} \le \Delta k$ is what is checked by the protocol.

\subsection{Liquidation Execution}

Any market participant can trigger the liquidation of an eligible position. The process executes the same logic as closing a position. When liquidated, $X_{\text{out}}$ is calculated. Since the position is at or below the liquidation threshold, $X_{\text{out}}$ will be zero or negative, meaning the trader loses their entire collateral, $c$.

A portion of the user's collateral is used to reward the liquidator, and the remainder may go to a protocol treasury. This ensures that liquidations are incentivized and the protocol remains solvent by restoring the invariant.

\section{Limbo State}

A unique feature of Whiplash is the "limbo state" for positions that experience extreme price movements.

\subsection{Mathematical Definition of Limbo}

A position enters limbo when it meets the liquidation condition but no liquidator has yet closed it:
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
&x_{\text{current}} \cdot y_{\text{position}} \le \Delta k \\
&\text{and no liquidator has fulfilled the liquidation}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Exiting Limbo}

A position can exit limbo if price movements cause its value to recover, such that it no longer meets the liquidation condition:

\begin{equation}
x_{\text{current}} \cdot y_{\text{position}} > \Delta k
\end{equation}

\section{System Properties and Guarantees}

Whiplash's design provides several important mathematical guarantees:

\subsection{Solvency Guarantee}

The solvency of the protocol is guaranteed by the zero-sum nature of the token supply and the constant product invariant:

\begin{equation}
\forall t: y_{\text{pool},t} + y_{\text{users},t} + \sum_{i} y_{\text{position},i,t} = y_{\text{total}}
\end{equation}

where $y_{\text{position},i,t}$ represents the tokens in the $i$-th leveraged position at time $t$.

\subsection{No Seed Capital Requirement}

The virtual reserves model eliminates the need for seed capital by ensuring:

\begin{equation}
\forall t: x_{\text{required},t} \leq \sum_{j} \text{deposits}_j
\end{equation}

where $\text{deposits}_j$ represents the base asset deposited by the $j$-th user for either spot or leverage trading.

\subsection{Zero Bad Debt Guarantee}

The protocol guarantees zero bad debt through its liquidation and limbo mechanisms:

\begin{equation}
\forall \text{ positions } i: \text{either } \begin{cases}
\text{position is healthy} \\
\text{position is liquidatable} \\
\text{position is in limbo}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

Under no circumstances can a position create a debt that the protocol cannot recover, as the fixed token supply ensures all positions are backed by real tokens.

\section{Conclusion}

Whiplash represents a paradigm shift in AMM design by enabling permissionless token launches with zero seed capital and unifying spot and leverage trading within a single framework. The mathematical foundation ensures that:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item New tokens can be launched without requiring liquidity providers
    \item Leverage trading can amplify the inherent volatility of memecoins
    \item The protocol remains solvent at all times through its novel approach to reserve management
    \item Traders are protected from flash crashes through the limbo mechanism
\end{enumerate}

By building on proven AMM mechanics while introducing innovative modifications, Whiplash creates a platform that makes "the world's most volatile asset class more volatile," providing a truly novel trading experience for memecoin enthusiasts.
